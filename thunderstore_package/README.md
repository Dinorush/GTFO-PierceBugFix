# PierceBugFix

Fixes piercing so that piercing shots hit the advertised number of enemies.

Currently there is a hardcoded limit of 5 hits before piercing shots stop checking for additional
hits. However, a single enemy can use up multiple of these hits, drastically reducing the number of
enemies that are actually hit, particularly for wide enemies.

This mod removes this hardcoded limit. It does so by directly modifying the assembly instructions of
the `BulletWeapon.Fire` and `Shotgun.Fire` methods. It changes the `inc` instruction which
increments the number counting up to 5 into a `nop` or do nothing instruction. This causes the
number to never reach 5, completely removing the hardcoded limit. Shots still naturally terminate
when hitting something non-damageable or if their actual piercing limit is reached.
